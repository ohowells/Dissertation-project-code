# Collision Detection Algorithms Focusing on Deformable Objects

The investigation documented the process of designing and implementing a collision
detection and response algorithm that focuses on Deformable objects, that is capable
of coping with rapid changes in the geometry of the colliding objects during the broad
and narrow phases. This report will attempt to highlight the importance and need for precise,
efficient and fast collision detection algorithms in modern applications and games.

## How was the project Implemented?

Collision detection system split into two phases.

Board & Narrow

Board phase checking is done with two approximative bounding spheres
Narrow phase is handled using a brute force style algorithm
